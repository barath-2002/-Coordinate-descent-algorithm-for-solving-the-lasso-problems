# Project Overview
This repository contains the code and documentation for the ST 443 group project. The project is divided into two parts:

## Part 1: Real World Data Analysis
In this part, we explore the application of statistical machine learning techniques on real datasets. The main components of the report include:

Data Description and Questions: Briefly describe the chosen datasets and the questions the analysis aims to answer.

Approaches Review: Review various regression and classification approaches covered in class.

Final Approach: Summarize the chosen approach and explain the reasoning behind the selection.

Results and Conclusion: Provide a summary of the results obtained and draw conclusions from the analysis.

## Part 2: Coordinate Descent Algorithm for Lasso and Elastic Net
This part focuses on implementing coordinate descent algorithms for solving the Lasso and Elastic Net problems. The project includes:

Lasso Algorithm: Implement the "one-at-a-time" coordinate descent algorithm for solving the Lasso problem.

Elastic Net Algorithm: Develop a coordinate descent algorithm for solving the Elastic Net problem.

Simulation Study: Conduct a simulation study to compare the prediction accuracy and variable selection performance of Lasso and Elastic Net.
